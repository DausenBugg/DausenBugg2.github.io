    <p>One problem I ran into was trying to get together with my teamates and make sure my UI was matching with their themes.
    I wanted to make sure whenever the user switched from activity to activity it wasn't jarring for the user to see entirely
    different themes of the app.</p>

    <p>I got my questionnaire UI to match the dashboard UI, but I have not connected with my other teammate to get the login 
    and registration page to match with our themes. It should only take about 30 minutes to fix so it should not be to big of a
    deal.</p>
