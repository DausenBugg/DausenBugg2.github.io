    <p>One problem I encountered was designing the questionnaire UI to have a clean, modern, and engaging look. 
        I struggled to find a balance between simplicity and visual appeal while ensuring the user experience remained intuitive. 
        This issue slowed down my progress as I had to go through multiple iterations of the design.</p>

    <p>To resolve this problem, I experimented with different styles and layouts until I found one that matched the aesthetic we wanted for Daily Fusion. 
        I also gathered feedback from my teammates to ensure the design was appealing and user-friendly. 
        Moving forward, I plan to refine the design even further as I start implementing it in our IntelliJ IDE.</p>
